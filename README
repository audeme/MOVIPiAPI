Getting MOVI to work on a Raspberry PI 3
========================================

1) Connect MOVI onto Raspberry Pi using adapter the Adapter sold by Audeme or the wiring scheme in this Instructable:
https://www.instructables.com/id/Untethered-Speech-Dialog-Using-MOVI-With-the-Rasbe/

Beware that some steps have changed. This README presents an update.

Connect the Raspberry PI to a power supply with at least 2 Amperes. If the power supply has not enough power, the Raspberry PI will complain "Undervoltage detected" and show a "Lightning bolt" in the upper right corner.

2) Download latest Raspbian:
https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/

Install on SDCard, start Raspberry PI, follow steps including updating process. 

3) Start a terminal and edit /boot/config.txt, for example: 

sudo nano /boot/config.txt

Add the following lines to the end of the file:

dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt 
core_freq=250
enable_uart=1

4) Now edit /boot/cmdline.txt

sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

remove the word phrase "console=serial0,115200" or "console=ttyAMA0,115200"

5) Reboot the Raspberry PI.

6) Find out which devices files exist now. This seems to be dynamic. 
For me: /dev/serial0 is the one that MOVI responds to. /dev/ttyS0 or /dev/serial1 give an input/output error. The easiest way to find out is to do an:
stty -a -F <devicefile> 
where devicefile is one of  /dev/ttyAMA0, /dev/serial0, /dev/ttyS0, or /dev/serial1. The one with the lowest number that doesn't return an error should be used.

7) Browse through the examples directory and play around with them...
All examples assume /dev/serial0. You may have to modify them if that's not your device file.
